How to upgrade from previous releases:
--------------------------------------
There are a lot of changes from the previous release. The upgrade process is therefor a little tricky.

Here we go:

- backup all files of the current release

- backup of the database

- copy all files of the new release over the old release

- copy config/dbConfig.php to application/configs/dbConfig.php

- edit the previous file dbConfig and remove the following 2 lines:
   if (!defined( 'SMART_SECURE_INCLUDE' )) 
   exit;
   
- copy project templates to the public/views/xxx folder

- edit your templates and remove the following lines if present:
   <!-- this line puts IE in quirk mode -->
   <!-- prevent direct call -->
   <?php if (!defined('SMART_SECURE_INCLUDE')) exit; ?>

- rename you templates: tpl.Xxx.php to view.Xxx.php

- copy your css files to the public/styles/xxx folder (may you have to correct the path in your templates)

- May you have to modify the default controllers in /application/controllers/default

- reload the "public page".

- load the admin page http://wwww.example.com/Module

- switch to the global options management and set the correct view,styles and controller folders.

- Remove old folder/files:
   - cache
   - config
   - css_home
   - logs
   - smart
   - templates_home
   - tests
   - views_cli
   - views_home
   - views_rpcserver
   - admin.php
   - cli.php
   - rpcserver.php
